What yordles lack in stature, they make up for with industriousness. Corki, the Daring Bombardier, gained his title by test-piloting one of these contributions - the original design for the Reconnaissance Operations Front-Line Copter, an aerial assault vehicle which has become the backbone of the Bandle City Expeditionary Force (BCEF). Together with his squadron - the Screaming Yipsnakes - Corki soars over Valoran, surveying the landscape and conducting aerial acrobatics for the benefit of onlookers below.<br><br>Corki is the most renowned of the Screaming Yipsnakes for remaining cool under fire and exhibiting bravery to the point of madness. Before the League, he served several tours of duty, often volunteering for missions that would take him behind enemy lines, either gathering intelligence or delivering messages through hot zones. He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a good dogfight in the morning. More than just an ace pilot, Corki also made several modifications to his copter, outfitting it with an arsenal of weapons which some speculate were more for show than functionality. When open hostilities ceased as part of the agreement surrounding the formation of the League, Corki was forced into a retirement, which he felt ''cut the engines and clipped the wings''. He tried to make do with stunt flying and canyon running, but it was never the same without the refreshing smell of gunpowder streaking through the air around him. When Heimerdinger joined the League of Legends, it was no surprise to see Corki follow soon after, eager to test his mettle against the best the world has to offer.<br><br>He is Corki - death from above!","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3,"mpregen":7.42,"attackrange":550,"attackspeedoffset":0,"mp":305.16,"hpperlevel":82,"hp":512.76,"hpregen":5.42,"mpregenperlevel":0.55,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":325,"mpperlevel":37,"armor":23.38,"armorperlevel":3.5,"attackdamage":51.24,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":2.3,"hpregenperlevel":0.55},"partype":"Mana","name":"Corki","id":42,"title":"the Daring Bombardier","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell1.png","x":192,"h":48,"y":144,"full":"PhosphorusBomb.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"8","cost":[60,70,80,90,100],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}"," {{ cost }} -> {{ costnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Mana Cost"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"825","tooltip":"Corki lobs a bomb, dealing {{ e1 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ f1 }})<\/span> <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> magic damage to enemies in the target area.
