Once Rek'Sai detects you, your fate is sealed. There is no hope of escape; she is death from below the sand.","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.35,"mpregen":0,"attackrange":175,"attackspeedoffset":0,"mp":100,"hpperlevel":90,"hp":611.2,"hpregen":7.34,"mpregenperlevel":0,"spellblock":32.1,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":335,"mpperlevel":0,"armor":28.3,"armorperlevel":3.75,"attackdamage":55.628,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":1.25,"attackspeedperlevel":2,"hpregenperlevel":0.65},"partype":"Battlefury","name":"Rek'Sai","id":421,"title":"the Void Burrower","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell13.png","x":48,"h":48,"y":48,"full":"RekSaiQ.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"4","cost":[0,0,0,0,0],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ e4 }} -> {{ e4NL }}","{{ e5 }} -> {{ e5NL }}"],"label":["Queen's Wrath Damage","Prey Seeker Damage","Prey Seeker Cooldown"]},"resource":"No Cost","rangeBurn":"325","tooltip":"<span class=\"colorFFFFFF\">Un-Burrowed:<\/span> Rek'Sai's next 3 basic attacks within 5 seconds deal {{ e1 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> bonus Physical Damage to nearby enemies.<br><br><span class=\"colorFFFFFF\">Burrowed:<\/span> Rek'Sai launches a burst of void-charged earth that explodes on first unit hit, dealing {{ e4 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a2 }})<\/span> Magic Damage and revealing non-stealthed enemies hit for {{ e6 }} seconds.","description":"Rek'Sai's next 3 basic attacks deal bonus Physical Damage to nearby enemies.<br><br>While Burrowed, Rek'Sai launches a burst of void-charged earth that deals Magic Damage and reveals enemies hit.","range":[325,325,325,325,325],"maxrank":5,"sanitizedTooltip":"Un-Burrowed: Rek'Sai's next 3 basic attacks within 5 seconds deal {{ e1 }} (+{{ a1 }}) bonus Physical Damage to nearby enemies.
