It is the magic of the earth, drawing power from the resonance of crystals and gems. Taric, the Gem Knight, is Runeterra's sole practitioner of this form of magic, having been erratically summoned to Runeterra from a faraway world. Back home, Taric's father was a distinguished healer in their home city. Taric was always interested in his father's pursuits, even from a young age. Despite his burgeoning understanding of herbs, plants, and animal medicines, it was the power of gems that most fascinated the growing boy. It wasn't long before Taric had exhausted his father's coveted library and set out on a path of his own. He wanted to help the people, but not by simply salving their wounds and curing their woes. He wasn't to be a healer, but a defender - one who used the power of earth to preserve and protect.<br><br>Taric became a wandering knight, renowned across his homeland as a guardian of the just until the day a spell of summoning grabbed him from his home and deposited him on Runeterra. Though disoriented and confused at first, he now feels that the continent of Valoran is in need of someone like him. Despite missing his homeland, Taric is happy to fight in the League, serving as a protector for all who seek one. His neat and stylish appearance combined with his shiny bejeweled armor and weapons have rapidly made him a celebrity champion of the League of Legends. Valoran's media, for some reason, has taken a great interest in his personal life. While open about his life as a champion and gracious in all things, Taric is tight-lipped about his life outside the League and prefers his privacy.<br><br>As Taric's father taught him, every stone has its meaning. For Taric's enemies, they all mean trouble.","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.5,"mpregen":4.1,"attackrange":125,"attackspeedoffset":0,"mp":255,"hpperlevel":90,"hp":468,"hpregen":7.1,"mpregenperlevel":0.4,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":340,"mpperlevel":56,"armor":20.5,"armorperlevel":3.2,"attackdamage":52,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":1.25,"attackspeedperlevel":2.02,"hpregenperlevel":0.5},"partype":"Mana","name":"Taric","id":44,"title":"the Gem Knight","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell10.png","x":96,"h":48,"y":0,"full":"Imbue.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"18/17/16/15/14","cost":[60,80,100,120,140],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}","{{ cost }} -> {{ costnNL }}"],"label":["Base Heal","Cooldown","Mana Cost"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"750","tooltip":"Taric brings forth earthen energy to heal a target ally and himself for {{ e1 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> <span class=\"colorFF3300\">(+{{ f1 }})<\/span> ({{ e6 }}% of Taric's bonus health).
