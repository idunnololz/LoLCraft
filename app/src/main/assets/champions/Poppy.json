Blomgrun, her father, was Bandle City's finest smith. The only thing he loved as much as his work was his young daughter, Poppy - named for the sprightly sounds of the sparks that leapt from his ever-burning forge. He welled with pride the day she was first able to lift his trusty hammer, Whomper. Poppy immediately took to his art, demonstrating a natural gift for smithing, which Blomgrun honed with devoted instruction.<br><br>One day, a Demacian general named Florin Berell commissioned Blomgrun to craft a helm, glorious beyond comparison.

Soon after, seeking to crush Noxus with her father's hammer, Poppy volunteered for the League of Legends.<br><br>Poppy may be small, but Whomper - or her will - is not.","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.375,"mpregen":7.155,"attackrange":125,"attackspeedoffset":-0.02,"mp":235.4,"hpperlevel":81,"hp":559.08,"hpregen":8.37,"mpregenperlevel":0.45,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":345,"mpperlevel":30,"armor":28.72,"armorperlevel":4,"attackdamage":61.97,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":3.35,"hpregenperlevel":0.55},"partype":"Mana","name":"Poppy","id":78,"title":"the Iron Ambassador","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell8.png","x":336,"h":48,"y":48,"full":"PoppyDevastatingBlow.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"8/7/6/5/4","cost":[55,55,55,55,55],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }}"," {{ e3 }} -> {{ e3NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Bonus Damage","Damage Cap","Cooldown"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"self","tooltip":"Poppy crushes her opponent, dealing {{ e2 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ a2 }})<\/span> <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> plus 8% of her target's maximum Health as Magic Damage.
