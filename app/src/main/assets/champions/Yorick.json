There are many shades of death there, and each is embraced rather than feared or reviled. One can only ascend from one state to the next with the magical aid of a skilled professional. At the end of the first Rune War, Yorick Mori made his living as a gravedigger. His family owned and maintained the Final Rest Memorial, one of the oldest cemeteries in Valoran. The shovel he employed for his work had been passed down for generations. Each gravedigger taught his son that this shovel was imbued with the spirit of every forefather, and that those spirits would protect him during the long lonely nights amongst the tombstones. To his eternal regret, Yorick died without an heir, bringing the proud Mori line to a close. His body was interred with his shovel in the family mausoleum, and the Final Rest Memorial soon fell to ruin. Death, however, was not the end Yorick had expected.<br><br>Yorick emerged on the haunted shores of the Shadow Isles - not quite dead, definitely not alive - still clutching his beloved shovel. He soon learned that with it he could act as a ferryman for the Isles' undead denizens, helping them climb death's many-tiered ladder. This proved a curse, as a gravedigger must ''bury his quota'' before he too can ascend, or so the legend goes. No one knows what ''his quota'' is. Yorick dug tirelessly, waiting in vain for the day when he would be freed of his burden. As decades turned to centuries, the shame of his failures came to a head. He returned to Valoran to find his corpse, convinced that salvation might be buried with it. When he arrived, no trace remained of either the mausoleum or the memorial. Hope nearly lost, he discovered the League of Legends, and there saw an opportunity to immortalize the family name he allowed to be forgotten ages ago.<br><br>''Die first, then we'll talk.''<br>-Yorick","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.5,"mpregen":6,"attackrange":125,"attackspeedoffset":0,"mp":235,"hpperlevel":85,"hp":421,"hpregen":7,"mpregenperlevel":0.45,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":345,"mpperlevel":35,"armor":19,"armorperlevel":3.6,"attackdamage":51.7,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":1.25,"attackspeedperlevel":3,"hpregenperlevel":0.7},"partype":"Mana","name":"Yorick","id":83,"title":"the Gravedigger","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell12.png","x":0,"h":48,"y":48,"full":"YorickSpectral.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"9/8/7/6/5","cost":[40,40,40,40,40],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }}","{{ e3 }}% -> {{ e3NL }}%","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Bonus Damage","Spectral Attack Damage","Movement Speed","Cooldown"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"self","tooltip":"Yorick's next attack will deal {{ e1 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> physical damage and summon a Spectral Ghoul for up to 5 seconds.<br><br>The Spectral Ghoul deals {{ e2 }} additional damage per hit and moves {{ e3 }}% faster.
