{"data":{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"champion3.png","x":432,"h":48,"y":0,"full":"TwistedFate.png","group":"champion"},"lore":"Although born to poor gypsy parents, the champion known as Twisted Fate was able to gamble his way to prosperity as a card shark in the seedy underground gambling circuits of Demacia and Noxus. No matter how close the authorities came to catching him, the rogue always found a way to slip through their fingers. Despite his good fortune, he was never able to win that which he truly desired - the ability to control magic. When Twisted Fate learned of an experiment being conducted in Zaun that might help him with his wish, he did the only thing a gambler of his worth could do - he went all in and volunteered for the experiment.<br><br>Conducted by the infamous Dr. Xavier Rath, Twisted Fate was told that the wager for such participation might be steep. He might change forever, or nothing might happen, or he might die horribly.  Pain, however, was likely a part of the deal no matter the outcome. These were hardly the worst odds the gambler had faced; his hopes raised, Twisted Fate underwent the experiment, enduring what he must for a chance at his dream. Then, it ended - with seemingly no effect whatsoever. The gypsy rogue flew into a murderous rage, but, before he could strike down the team, he suddenly teleported himself miles away.  With a sly grin, he realized his luck had won out yet again. He now brings his luck and rakish charm to the Institute of War, where he is the Champion of choice for many - especially the gambling kind. To this day, Twisted Fate has avoided his inevitable reunion with Dr. Rath. The Card Master knows, however, that a confrontation is coming.<br><br>While the future may be mysterious and unknown to most, Twisted Fate is certain that his future lies within the cards.","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.3,"mpregen":6,"attackrange":525,"attackspeedoffset":-0.04,"mp":265.84,"hpperlevel":82,"hp":521.76,"hpregen":5.505,"mpregenperlevel":0.8,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":330,"mpperlevel":38,"armor":20.542,"armorperlevel":3.15,"attackdamage":49.954,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":3.22,"hpregenperlevel":0.6},"partype":"Mana","name":"Twisted Fate","id":4,"title":"the Card Master","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell10.png","x":288,"h":48,"y":96,"full":"WildCards.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"6","cost":[60,70,80,90,100],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ cost }} -> {{ costnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Mana Cost"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"10000","tooltip":"Throws three cards that deal {{ e1 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> Magic Damage to each enemy unit they pass through.","description":"Twisted Fate throws three cards, dealing damage to each enemy unit they pass through.","range":[10000,10000,10000,10000,10000],"analysis":[[-1879048189,1,60,110,160,210,260,0.65,"spelldamage"]],"maxrank":5,"sanitizedTooltip":"Throws three cards that deal {{ e1 }} (+{{ a1 }}) Magic Damage to each enemy unit they pass through.","costType":"Mana","effect":[null,[60,110,160,210,260],[40,55,70,85,100]],"name":"Wild Cards","cooldown":[6,6,6,6,6],"costBurn":"60/70/80/90/100","vars":[{"link":"spelldamage","key":"a1","coeff":[0.65]}],"sanitizedDescription":"Twisted Fate throws three cards, dealing damage to each enemy unit they pass through.","effectBurn":["","60/110/160/210/260","40/55/70/85/100"],"key":"WildCards"},{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell10.png","x":336,"h":48,"y":96,"full":"PickACard.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"6","cost":[40,55,70,85,100],"leveltip":{"effect":[" {{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ e6 }} -> {{ e6NL }}","","{{ e4 }} -> {{ e4NL }}","{{ e2 }}% -> {{ e2NL }}%","","{{ e5 }} -> {{ e5NL }}","{{ e3 }} -> {{ e3NL }}","","{{ cost }} -> {{ costnNL }}"],"label":["Blue Card Damage","Blue Card Mana Restore","","Red Card Damage","Red Card Slow %","","Gold Card Damage","Gold Card Stun Duration","","Mana Cost"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"self","tooltip":"Cast once to shuffle the deck and again to choose your card, enhancing your next attack.<br><br><span class=\"color0000FF\">Blue Card<\/span> deals {{ e1 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ a2 }})<\/span> <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> Magic Damage and restores {{ e6 }} Mana.<br><br><span class=\"colorFF0000\">Red Card<\/span> deals {{ e4 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ a2 }})<\/span> <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> Magic Damage to units around the target and slows their Movement Speed by {{ e2 }}% for 2.5 seconds.<br><br><span class=\"colorFFD700\">Gold Card<\/span> deals {{ e5 }}<span class=\"colorFF8C00\"> (+{{ a2 }})<\/span> <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> Magic Damage and stuns for {{ e3 }} seconds.","description":"Twisted Fate chooses a magic card from his deck, and uses that for his next attack, causing bonus effects.","range":"self","analysis":[[268435459,2,40,60,80,100,120,1,"attackdamage",0.5,"spelldamage",15728640],[-1879048189,2,30,45,60,75,90,1,"attackdamage",0.5,"spelldamage",15728640],[268435459,2,15,22.5,30,37.5,45,1,"attackdamage",0.5,"spelldamage"],[4,0,-2147483646,0.3,2.5,0.35,2.5,0.4,2.5,0.45,2.5,0.5,2.5],[4,0,4,1,1.25,1.5,1.75,2]],"maxrank":5,"sanitizedTooltip":"Cast once to shuffle the deck and again to choose your card, enhancing your next attack.
