Much of that world still bears the scars of past Runes Wars, especially the mysterious Kumungu Jungle. There are long-forgotten treasures in these strange places which many risk life and limb to acquire. The champion known as Nidalee was only a young girl travelling with her treasure-seeking parents when they lost their way in the dense, rainy jungles. The jungle was unforgiving, and she watched her parents suffer agonizing final days as they fell victim to a mysterious and vicious disease.<br><br>As improbable as it was for a child to survive in the inhospitable jungle by herself, she did just that. Her youthful innocence and a fortunate naivete caused her to appeal to the beasts of that place and she was taken in by a family of cougars and raised as one of their own. She grew and somehow absorbed the raw magic of the dense wilds, evolving beyond both her human physiology and her feline affectation. On one pivotal day in her life, standing over the torn remnants of a Noxian squad of woodcutters, Nidalee chose to rejoin the so-called civilized world, to fight in the League of Legends so as to protect the vast woods from both Demacia and Noxus.<br><br>Nidalee was taught to fight by her feline family, battling viciously with tooth and nail. Something in her feline ways may draw you to her, but remember that she is no pussycat.","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.5,"mpregen":6,"attackrange":525,"attackspeedoffset":-0.02,"mp":295.6,"hpperlevel":90,"hp":541.2,"hpregen":6.005,"mpregenperlevel":0.8,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":335,"mpperlevel":45,"armor":22.88,"armorperlevel":3.5,"attackdamage":47.88,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":3.22,"hpregenperlevel":0.6},"partype":"Mana","name":"Nidalee","id":76,"title":"the Bestial Huntress","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell7.png","x":0,"h":48,"y":48,"full":"JavelinToss.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"6","cost":[50,60,70,80,90],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }}","{{ e3 }} -> {{ e3NL }}"],"label":["Javelin Minimum Damage","Javelin Maximum Damage","Javelin Mana Cost"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"1500","tooltip":"<span class=\"size18 colorFF9900\">Human: <\/span>Nidalee tosses her javelin, dealing {{ e1 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a2 }})<\/span> magic damage.
