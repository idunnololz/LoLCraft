It is said that he was the first of the undead, existing before the Shadow Isles were a whispered threat. His true name and past lost to history, Mordekaiser is feared for his grim manipulation of pain - both his own, and that of others. Anguish fuels and sustains him, serving as his last connection to life, as well as his most effective weapon. In his enigmatic hunt, he's proven no one is safe, for even the most courageous souls have surrendered their secrets in his grasp.<br><br>One girl witnessed and survived an encounter with pain's paladin. Late one night, the young mage-in-training was awoken by the sound of her master's tortured screams. Overcoming her fear, she charged into the library to find it a shattered ruin. There, she saw a hulking figure clad in a suit of armor that seemed fused to his body. It was clear the grim intruder was looking for something, and was displeased with the results. At the center of the once-majestic chamber, the armored fiend clutched her teacher's broken form. She overheard her master's final words - that he would die before he would give up his secrets. Mordekaiser laughed and said that even death was no escape, then snapped the master's neck with a sharp crack. Moments later, the horrified girl witnessed her master's spirit torn from his body. As if under some dark compulsion, the shade began to reveal all to his torturer and executioner. The girl fled, living to tell her story - should Mordekaiser come for you, even death itself will not keep you from his iron reach.<br><br>''Fear is confusion, pain is clarity.''<br>-- Mordekaiser","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.5,"mpregen":0,"attackrange":125,"attackspeedoffset":-0.1,"mp":120,"hpperlevel":80,"hp":421,"hpregen":7.45,"mpregenperlevel":0,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":340,"mpperlevel":0,"armor":19,"armorperlevel":3.5,"attackdamage":51.7,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":1.25,"attackspeedperlevel":3,"hpregenperlevel":0.55},"partype":"Shield","name":"Mordekaiser","id":82,"title":"the Master of Metal","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell6.png","x":240,"h":48,"y":0,"full":"MordekaiserMaceOfSpades.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"8/7/6/5/4","cost":[0,0,0,0,0],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}","{{ e3 }} -> {{ e3NL }}"],"label":["Bonus Damage","Cooldown","Health Cost"]},"resource":"{{ e3 }} Health","rangeBurn":"self","tooltip":"On next hit, Mordekaiser swings his mace with such force that it echoes out, striking up to 3 additional nearby targets, dealing {{ e2 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ f2 }})<\/span> <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> Magic Damage.<\/span> <br><br>If the target is alone, {{ e1 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ f1 }})<\/span> <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a2 }})<\/span> damage is dealt instead.","description":"On next hit, Mordekaiser swings his mace with such force that it echoes out, striking up to 3 additional nearby targets, dealing damage plus bonus damage.
