Entombed in ancient armor, the Master of Metal is said to be the first of the unliving, a revenant who existed even before the Shadow Isles were wrought. His twisted soul thrives on his own suffering, as well as the anguish he inflicts upon others. Those who dare face Mordekaiser in battle risk a horrific curse: he enslaves his victims' souls to become instruments of destruction.","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.5,"mpregen":0,"attackrange":125,"attackspeedoffset":-0.1,"mp":120,"hpperlevel":80,"hp":555.4,"hpregen":8.37,"mpregenperlevel":0,"spellblock":32.1,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":340,"mpperlevel":0,"armor":24.88,"armorperlevel":3.5,"attackdamage":57.58,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":1.25,"attackspeedperlevel":3,"hpregenperlevel":0.55},"partype":"Shield","name":"Mordekaiser","id":82,"title":"the Master of Metal","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell6.png","x":0,"h":48,"y":144,"full":"MordekaiserMaceOfSpades.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"8/7/6/5/4","cost":[0,0,0,0,0],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}","{{ e3 }} -> {{ e3NL }}"],"label":["Bonus Damage","Cooldown","Health Cost"]},"resource":"{{ e3 }} Health","rangeBurn":"self","tooltip":"On next hit, Mordekaiser swings his mace with such force that it echoes out, striking up to 3 additional nearby targets, dealing {{ e2 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ f2 }})<\/span> <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> Magic Damage.<\/span> <br><br>If the target is alone, {{ e1 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ f1 }})<\/span> <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a2 }})<\/span> magic damage is dealt instead.","description":"On next hit, Mordekaiser swings his mace with such force that it echoes out, striking up to 3 additional nearby targets, dealing damage plus bonus damage.
