Persecution forged her into a brutal warrior, and those who dare stand against Shyvana face the fiery beast lurking just beneath her skin.<br><br>Dragonkind considered Shyvana's impure blood an abomination, and she spent her youth pursued relentlessly by one cruel drake. Constantly on the run, she and her father, an outcast dragon, never knew a lasting home. A brutal reflection of countless battles, Shyvana grew hateful and savage. After years of strife, her father finally fell to the other dragon, but not before gravely wounding his foe. Furious with grief, Shyvana pursued her father's murderer as he fled north to recover. There she encountered a group of humans on the trail of the same drake. Though the men looked upon her in fear, their leader approached Shyvana peacefully. He introduced himself as Jarvan IV, the Prince of Demacia, and offered to aid Shyvana in her quest for vengeance. Together they hunted down and confronted the vicious dragon that had slain her father. Shyvana did not expect the men to survive, but in the clash of fire and steel, Jarvan and his men fought with strength she had never believed humans to possess. The ironclad warriors drove their foe into submission, and Shyvana struck the final blow, tearing the beast's heart from its body. Inspired by her ferocity, Jarvan offered her a place in the ranks of his elite guard. Shyvana could still see fear in the eyes of his men, but she longed for a true home. Trusting Jarvan's word, she accepted his offer and now serves as a Demacian warrior. Though her human allies admire her power, they keep their distance. Shyvana strives to repay the prince's kindness with the power of the dragon within, but she cannot help but wonder if the humans are right to fear her.<br><br>''I have proven my might to dragonkind - what challenge shall humans pose?''<br>-- Shyvana","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.4,"mpregen":0,"attackrange":125,"attackspeedoffset":-0.05,"mp":100,"hpperlevel":95,"hp":594.6,"hpregen":8.59,"mpregenperlevel":0,"spellblock":32.1,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":350,"mpperlevel":0,"armor":27.628,"armorperlevel":3.35,"attackdamage":60.712,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":1.25,"attackspeedperlevel":2.5,"hpregenperlevel":0.8},"partype":"Dragonfury","name":"Shyvana","id":102,"title":"the Half-Dragon","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell8.png","x":144,"h":48,"y":48,"full":"ShyvanaDoubleAttack.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"10/9/8/7/6","cost":[0,0,0,0,0],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }}% -> {{ e1NL }}%","{{ cooldown }} ->{{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Bonus Damage","Cooldown"]},"resource":"No Cost","rangeBurn":"self","tooltip":"Shyvana strikes twice on her next attack, dealing <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ f1 }})<\/span> physical damage on the second attack.
