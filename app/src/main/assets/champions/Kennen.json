Order, chaos, light, darkness -- all things must exist in perfect harmony for such is the way of the universe. This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors to uphold its causes in the world. Kennen is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of Coursing the Sun - tirelessly conveying the justice of the Kinkou.<br><br>Kennen was born in Bandle City and it was said that in his first living moments he bolted first from the womb and second from the midwife who delivered him. His parents had thought that he would outgrow his boundless energy, but as he matured his energy found no limits and was matched only by his unnerving speed. Despite his astonishing gifts, he remained unnoticed (or at least uncaught, as he was quite the prankster) until, on a dare, he ran straight up the great outer wall of the Placidium. When word of this feat reached Kinkou ears, Kennen was quickly and quietly brought in for an audience. He found that the role of the Heart of the Tempest suited him, frenetically delivering both the word and the punishments of the Kinkou across the realm. He now works with his fellows Akali and Shen to enforce the balance of Valoran. This hallowed pursuit has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of Justice.<br><br>''The Heart of the Tempest beats eternal...and those beaten remember eternally.''","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.3,"mpregen":50,"attackrange":550,"attackspeedoffset":-0.0947,"mp":200,"hpperlevel":79,"hp":535.72,"hpregen":5.59,"mpregenperlevel":0,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":335,"mpperlevel":0,"armor":24.3,"armorperlevel":3.75,"attackdamage":50.544,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":3.4,"hpregenperlevel":0.65},"partype":"Energy","name":"Kennen","id":85,"title":"the Heart of the Tempest","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell4.png","x":336,"h":48,"y":144,"full":"KennenShurikenHurlMissile1.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"8/7/6/5/4","cost":[65,60,55,50,45],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ cost }} -> {{ costnNL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Energy Cost","Cooldown"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Energy","rangeBurn":"950","tooltip":"Throws a shuriken that deals {{ e1 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> magic damage to the first enemy it hits.","description":"Kennen throws a fast moving shuriken towards a location, causing damage and adding a Mark of the Storm to any opponent that it hits.","range":[950,950,950,950,950],"analysis":[[268435459,1,75,115,155,195,235,0.75,"spelldamage"]],"maxrank":5,"sanitizedTooltip":"Throws a shuriken that deals {{ e1 }} (+{{ a1 }}) magic damage to the first enemy it hits.","costType":"Energy","effect":[null,[75,115,155,195,235],[900,1000,1100,1200,1300],[20,35,50,65,80],[75,125,175,225,250]],"name":"Thundering Shuriken","cooldown":[8,7,6,5,4],"costBurn":"65/60/55/50/45","vars":[{"link":"spelldamage","key":"a1","coeff":[0.75]}],"sanitizedDescription":"Kennen throws a fast moving shuriken towards a location, causing damage and adding a Mark of the Storm to any opponent that it hits.","effectBurn":["","75/115/155/195/235","900/1000/1100/1200/1300","20/35/50/65/80","75/125/175/225/250"],"key":"KennenShurikenHurlMissile1"},{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell4.png","x":384,"h":48,"y":144,"full":"KennenBringTheLight.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"14/12/10/8/6","cost":[45,45,45,45,45],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e2 }}% -> {{ e2NL }}%","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}","{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}"],"label":["Passive %","Cooldown","Active Damage"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Energy","rangeBurn":"900","tooltip":"<span class=\"colorFF9900\">Passive:<\/span> Every 5 attacks, Kennen deals bonus magic damage equal to {{ e2 }}% of his attack damage and adds a Mark of the Storm to his target.<br><br><span class=\"colorFF9900\">Active:<\/span> Sends a surge of electricity through all nearby targets afflicted by Mark of the Storm, dealing {{ e1 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> magic damage.","description":"Kennen passively deals extra damage and adds a Mark of the Storm to his target every few attacks, and he can activate this ability to damage and add another Mark of the Storm to targets who are already marked.","range":[900,900,900,900,900],"analysis":[[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,0.1,0.12,0.14,0.16,"attackdamage","FlatAaMagicDamageMod"],[-1879048189,1,65,95,125,155,185,0.55,"spelldamage"]],"maxrank":5,"sanitizedTooltip":"Passive: Every 5 attacks, Kennen deals bonus magic damage equal to {{ e2 }}% of his attack damage and adds a Mark of the Storm to his target.
