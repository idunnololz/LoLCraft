He craved recognition, acclaim, and glory. He first sought greatness in the Noxian military, but his flair for the dramatic went severely underappreciated. Thirsting for a method to share ''Draven'' with the world, he turned his attention to the prison system. There he carved out the celebrity he desired by turning the tedious affair of executions into a premiere spectacle.<br><br>At Draven's first execution, he shocked onlookers when he ordered the doomed prisoner to run for dear life. Just before the man managed to flee from sight, Draven brought him down with a flawless throw of his axe. Soon, all Draven's executions became a gauntlet through which Noxian prisoners raced for a final chance at life. He used this trial as his own personal stage, and turned executions into a leading form of entertainment. He rallied onlookers into a frenzy, while desperate prisoners scrambled to evade him. They never succeeded. Rejecting the solemn, black uniforms of Noxian executioners Draven donned bright outfits and developed flashy signature moves to distinguish himself. Crowds flocked to see Draven in action, and tales of his performances spread quickly. As his popularity grew, so did his already-inflated ego. He belonged at the center of attention. Before long, the scope of his ambitions outgrew the population of Noxus. He decided that the glorious exploits of Draven should be put on display for the entire world.<br><br>'' 'The best' is wherever I decide to set the bar each day.''<br>-- Draven","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.5,"mpregen":8.04,"attackrange":550,"attackspeedoffset":-0.08,"mp":310.56,"hpperlevel":82,"hp":557.76,"hpregen":6.175,"mpregenperlevel":0.65,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":330,"mpperlevel":42,"armor":25.544,"armorperlevel":3.3,"attackdamage":50.38,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":2.7,"hpregenperlevel":0.7},"partype":"Mana","name":"Draven","id":119,"title":"the Glorious Executioner","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell2.png","x":336,"h":48,"y":0,"full":"DravenSpinning.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"12/11/10/9/8","cost":[45,45,45,45,45],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e2 }}% -> {{ e2NL }}%","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Bonus Damage","Cooldown"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"self","tooltip":"Draven's next attack will deal <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">{{ f1 }}<\/span> bonus physical damage.
