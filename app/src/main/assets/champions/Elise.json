While her victims may discover her true intentions, no one has ever lived to reveal what dark secrets lie behind her enigmatic guise.<br><br>In dark halls, hidden from society, Elise preached the word of a mythical spider god. Her desperate followers hungered for the god's favor, believing its blessings to be the source of Elise's vibrance and power. When Elise proclaimed that she would lead a pilgrimage to the spider god's shrine, she selected only her most devout disciples to join her. Ecstatic, the chosen few followed her blindly as she led them on a perilous journey across the sea. When they came ashore at their final destination, the mysterious Shadow Isles, Elise led them to a cavern shrouded in webs. Expecting a shrine, the group looked to their priestess in confusion. She turned to the crowd and raised her arms in triumph, revealing strange, spiderlike legs that grew out of her back. Seeing her terrifying true form for the first time, Elise's followers turned to flee, but she conjured magical webs to trap them. With her victims ensnared, she turned to face the cave and uttered a screeching cry. An enormous undead spider-beast emerged from the darkness, dragging its hideous bulk on thick, pointed legs. Elise's followers could only scream as the monstrous spider ate them alive. She approached the sated creature, extracted its venom, and drank the strange substance. An immediate sense of rejuvenation flowed through her veins. With mortality delayed once again, Elise left to rejoin her congregation. They were overjoyed to hear that their fellows had chosen to remain at the spider god's sacred home. Elise reassured her disciples that she would lead another pilgrimage in due time. The spider god would be waiting.<br><br>''The truly faithful need not fear the spider's embrace.''<br>-- Elise","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3,"mpregen":6.8,"attackrange":550,"attackspeedoffset":0,"mp":240,"hpperlevel":80,"hp":395,"hpregen":4.7,"mpregenperlevel":0.65,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":335,"mpperlevel":50,"armor":16.5,"armorperlevel":3.35,"attackdamage":47.5,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":1.75,"hpregenperlevel":0.6},"partype":"Mana","name":"Elise","id":60,"title":"The Spider Queen","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell2.png","x":192,"h":48,"y":48,"full":"EliseHumanQ.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"6","cost":[80,85,90,95,100],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ e5 }} -> {{ e5NL }}","{{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }}","{{ cost }} -> {{ costnNL }}"],"label":["Neurotoxin Damage","Venomous Bite Damage","Max Damage to Monsters","Mana Cost"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"625","tooltip":"Deals Magic Damage equal to {{ e1 }} plus 8% <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }}%)<\/span> of the target's current Health.
