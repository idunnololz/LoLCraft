The easygoing half-pint race, though fierce, is often regarded with some degree of joviality. Their high-pitched voices and naturally cute forms inspire something of a protective instinct in the larger races, or at least bring to mind images of children playing at being adults. Every now and again, however, a yordle turns so bad that even at its small stature it strikes terror into the hearts of others. Veigar is one such twisted yordle. As a master of the magical black arts, as well as a corrupter of cosmic energy, he is one of the most powerful sorcerers on Valoran.<br><br>As a child, Veigar was a normal yordle with one small exception - he had a deep curiosity for the world beyond Bandle City. The young yordle spent much of his time studying the rest of Valoran, and he jumped at the chance to join a business that traded with other major city-states. Unfortunately for both him and the world, a deal with Noxian trader turned into shady business and went bad; Veigar and his companions were subsequently set up to take the fall. Arrested by the authorities, he was imprisoned within the walls of Noxus for years. Such isolation is very dangerous for yordles - undoubtedly why his cruel jailers did such a thing - and Veigar was slowly driven mad.<br><br>He eventually escaped, having become a twisted version of his former self. Instead of returning to his people and Bandle City, he sought tutelage from dark wizards across the land. With his demented will focused on one task, he quickly became a dangerous and powerful wizard in his own right. Now he seeks to end all conflict on Valoran by bringing all of the city-states to their knees, regardless of their affiliation. The League of Legends is the perfect tool to help him meet his ends - for now.<br><br>Who says evil needs to come in a fearsome-looking package?","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":2.625,"mpregen":6,"attackrange":525,"attackspeedoffset":0,"mp":342.4,"hpperlevel":82,"hp":492.76,"hpregen":5.42,"mpregenperlevel":0.8,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":340,"mpperlevel":55,"armor":22.55,"armorperlevel":3.75,"attackdamage":50.71,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":2.24,"hpregenperlevel":0.55},"partype":"Mana","name":"Veigar","id":45,"title":"the Tiny Master of Evil","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell11.png","x":336,"h":48,"y":144,"full":"VeigarBalefulStrike.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"7/6.5/6/5.5/5","cost":[60,65,70,75,80],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}","{{ cost }} -> {{ costnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Champion Kill AP Gain","Cooldown","Mana Cost"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"900","tooltip":"<span class=\"colorFF9900\">Active: <\/span>Unleashes a bolt of dark energy, dealing {{ e1 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> Magic Damage to the first two enemies hit.
