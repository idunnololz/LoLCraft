{"data":{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"champion1.png","x":432,"h":48,"y":96,"full":"MissFortune.png","group":"champion"},"lore":"For those who brave the harsh seas of Runeterra, attaining one's own ship and crew is the pinnacle of success. Sarah Fortune, a well-respected (some would say legendary) bounty hunter from Bilgewater, was able to achieve this feat just after her sixteenth birthday, etching out her name as the go-to gal for resolving special troubles. No bounty was too difficult or too dangerous for her feminine charm and her renowned use of her twin pistols, ''Shock and Awe''. Her success gave her the means to legitimately purchase her own ship... with a little flirtatious haggling, of course. Things weren't always so fortunate for Miss Fortune, though. When she was young, trade ships began to dot the horizon of her quiet home in the northern shores of Blue Flame Island's largest chunk. Trade routes brought piracy, and the inhabitants soon found themselves caught in a frenzy of pillage.<br><br>One day, young Sarah returned home to hear gunshots and screaming. Her front door was smashed open; inside, she saw her mother lying in a pool of blood. A sudden blow to her head made her collapse next to her slain mother. The last thing she could remember were her attacker's red eyes, as his face was blocked by a rogue's bandana. Miss Fortune has a strong distrust for pirates and she finds herself constantly bickering with the infamous Gangplank (the only captain to resist her charms) over the direction of Bilgewater politics. Her two goals: to unite the people of Bilgewater, making them into a strong and independent society, and to find the pirate who killed her mother. To that end, she has entered the League of Legends as a champion, trading her skills for the wealth and influence that will help her accomplish both.","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3,"mpregen":8.04,"attackrange":550,"attackspeedoffset":-0.04734,"mp":275.84,"hpperlevel":85,"hp":577.8,"hpregen":6.19,"mpregenperlevel":0.65,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":325,"mpperlevel":38,"armor":24.04,"armorperlevel":3,"attackdamage":49.54,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":3.01,"hpregenperlevel":0.65},"partype":"Mana","name":"Miss Fortune","id":21,"title":"the Bounty Hunter","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell6.png","x":96,"h":48,"y":96,"full":"MissFortuneRicochetShot.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"7/6/5/4/3","cost":[43,46,49,52,55],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ cost }} -> {{ costnNL }} ","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }} ","{{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }} ","{{ e4 }} -> {{ e4NL }} "],"label":["Mana Cost","Cooldown","Damage to 1st target","Damage to 2nd target"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"650","tooltip":"Miss Fortune fires a shot through an enemy to hit another enemy behind them, dealing {{ e2 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ f1 }})<\/span> <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> physical damage to the first target and {{ e4 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ f2 }})<\/span> <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a2 }})<\/span> physical damage to the second.","description":"Miss Fortune fires a bullet at an enemy, damaging them and a target behind them.","range":[650,650,650,650,650],"analysis":[[134217731,2,20,35,50,65,80,0.85,"attackdamage",0.35,"spelldamage"]],"maxrank":5,"sanitizedTooltip":"Miss Fortune fires a shot through an enemy to hit another enemy behind them, dealing {{ e2 }} (+{{ f1 }}) (+{{ a1 }}) physical damage to the first target and {{ e4 }} (+{{ f2 }}) (+{{ a2 }}) physical damage to the second.","costType":"Mana","effect":[null,[0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85],[20,35,50,65,80],[1,1,1,1,1],[40,70,100,130,160],[40,40,40,40,40],[20,20,20,20,20],[40,40,40,40,40],[110,110,110,110,110],[160,160,160,160,160]],"name":"Double Up","cooldown":[7,6,5,4,3],"costBurn":"43/46/49/52/55","vars":[{"link":"spelldamage","key":"a1","coeff":[0.35]},{"link":"spelldamage","key":"a2","coeff":[0.5]}],"sanitizedDescription":"Miss Fortune fires a bullet at an enemy, damaging them and a target behind them.","effectBurn":["","0.85","20/35/50/65/80","1","40/70/100/130/160","40","20","40","110","160"],"key":"MissFortuneRicochetShot"},{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell6.png","x":144,"h":48,"y":96,"full":"MissFortuneViciousStrikes.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"16","cost":[30,35,40,45,50],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ cost }} -> {{ costnNL }} ","{{ e1 }}% -> {{ e1NL }}% "],"label":["Mana Cost","Attack Speed"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"self","tooltip":"<span class=\"colorFF9900\">Passive:<\/span> Basic attacks deal <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">{{ f1 }}<\/span> bonus magic damage, stacking cumulatively up to {{ f3 }} times for a maximum of <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">{{ f2 }}<\/span> bonus magic damage.<br><br><span class=\"colorFF9900\">Active: <\/span>Gains {{ e1 }}% Attack Speed for 6 seconds and causes basic attacks to apply Grievous Wounds to enemies, reducing their incoming healing and Health Regeneration by 50% for 2 seconds.","description":"Miss Fortune passively increases damage dealt to a target with each strike.
