He wields his massive blade with grace and poise, slicing through legions in a style that is hypnotic to behold. With each foe felled, Aatrox's seemingly living blade drinks in their blood, empowering him and fueling his brutal, elegant campaign of slaughter.<br><br>The earliest tale of Aatrox is as old as recorded history. It tells of a war between two great factions remembered only as the Protectorate and the Magelords. Over time, the Magelords won a series of crushing victories, leaving them on the brink of obliterating their sworn enemy forever. On the day of their final confrontation, the Protectorate army found themselves outnumbered, exhausted, and poorly equipped. They braced for inevitable defeat.<br><br>Just when all hope seemed lost, Aatrox appeared among the ranks of the Protectorate. With but a few words, he urged the soldiers to fight to the last before throwing himself into battle. His presence inspired the desperate warriors. At first, they could only watch in awe as this unknown hero cleaved through their enemies, his body and blade moving in unison as if one being. Soon, the warriors found themselves imbued with a potent thirst for battle. They followed Aatrox into the fray, each fighting with the furious strength of ten until they had won a most unlikely victory.<br><br>Aatrox vanished after that battle, but the Protectorate army's newfound fury did not. Their surprising triumph led to many more until they were able to finally return home victorious. Their countrymen hailed them as heroes, but though they had saved their entire civilization from destruction, darkness lingered in the mind of each warrior. Something within them had changed. Over time, their memories of battle faded, only to be replaced with a grim revelation: their acts of heroism were, in fact, brutal atrocities committed by their own hands.<br><br>Tales like these appear among the myths of many cultures. If they are all to be believed, Aatrox's presence has changed the course of some of the most important wars in history. Though these stories remember him as a savior in dark times, Aatrox's true legacy may be a world filled with conflict and strife.<br><br>''Some fight for honor, some fight for glory. It matters only that you fight.''<br>-- Aatrox","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.2,"mpregen":0,"attackrange":150,"attackspeedoffset":-0.04,"mp":105.6,"hpperlevel":85,"hp":537.8,"hpregen":6.59,"mpregenperlevel":0,"spellblock":32.1,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":345,"mpperlevel":45,"armor":24.384,"armorperlevel":3.8,"attackdamage":60.376,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":1.25,"attackspeedperlevel":3,"hpregenperlevel":0.5},"partype":"BloodWell","name":"Aatrox","id":266,"title":"the Darkin Blade","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell0.png","x":192,"h":48,"y":48,"full":"AatroxQ.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"16/15/14/13/12","cost":[0,0,0,0,0],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Cooldown"]},"resource":"{{ e3 }}% of current Health ","rangeBurn":"600","tooltip":"Aatrox takes flight and slams down at a targeted location, dealing {{ e1 }}<span class=\"colorF88017\"> (+{{ a1 }})<\/span> physical damage to all nearby enemies and knocking up targets at the center of impact for {{ e5 }} second.","description":"Aatrox takes flight and slams down at a targeted location, dealing damage and knocking up enemies at the center of impact.","range":[600,600,600,600,600],"analysis":[[134217731,1,70,115,160,205,250,0.6,"bonusattackdamage"],[4,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]],"maxrank":5,"sanitizedTooltip":"Aatrox takes flight and slams down at a targeted location, dealing {{ e1 }} (+{{ a1 }}) physical damage to all nearby enemies and knocking up targets at the center of impact for {{ e5 }} second.","costType":"pofcurrentHealth","effect":[null,[70,115,160,205,250],[22,20,18,16,14],[10,10,10,10,10],[225,225,225,225,225],[1,1,1,1,1]],"name":"Dark Flight","cooldown":[16,15,14,13,12],"costBurn":"0","vars":[{"link":"bonusattackdamage","key":"a1","coeff":[0.6]}],"sanitizedDescription":"Aatrox takes flight and slams down at a targeted location, dealing damage and knocking up enemies at the center of impact.","effectBurn":["","70/115/160/205/250","22/20/18/16/14","10","225","1"],"key":"AatroxQ"},{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell0.png","x":240,"h":48,"y":48,"full":"AatroxW.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"0.5","cost":[0,0,0,0,0],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e3 }} -> {{ e3NL }}","{{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }}"],"label":["Heal","Bonus Damage"]},"resource":"No Cost","rangeBurn":"self","tooltip":"While toggled off Aatrox benefits from Blood Thirst, while toggled on Blood Price is activated and removes Blood Thirst.<br><br><span class=\"colorFF9900\">Blood Thirst: <\/span>Every third attack, Aatrox restores {{ e3 }}<span class=\"colorF88017\"> (+{{ a1 }})<\/span> Health, increased by {{ e1 }}% ({{ f5 }}) when below half Health.<br><br><span class=\"colorFF9900\">Blood Price: <\/span>Every third attack, Aatrox deals {{ e2 }}<span class=\"colorF88017\"> (+{{ a2 }})<\/span> <\/span>bonus physical damage and loses <span class=\"colorCC3300\">{{ f4 }}<\/span> Health.","description":"While toggled on Aatrox deals bonus damage every third subsequent attack at the expense of his own Health.
