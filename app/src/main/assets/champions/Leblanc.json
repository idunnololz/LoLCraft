Noxus - though its name is already invoked with a mixture of reverence and revulsion - is no exception to this simple truth. Deep within the winding dungeons that honeycomb the earth beneath its dark, meandering streets lies the real underbelly of this sprawling metropolis, a haven for all manner of malevolence. Amongst the cults, covens, and secret societies that call this labyrinth their home, LeBlanc, the Deceiver, presides over the Black Rose, a remnant from a lost, yet similarly unscrupulous time in Noxian history. Ruthless and seemingly ageless, LeBlanc and her ilk were a mainstay in Noxian political affairs during the era before the militarization of the Noxian government. In those days, this guild of powerful magicians met in secret to further their hidden agenda, and to hone a craft more subtle than that preferred by those currently in power.<br><br>While their exact motives have always remained mysterious, it was widely believed that the Black Rose was the true power behind the throne while the aristocracy still reigned in Noxus. When raw martial prowess became the ultimate determination of whose will held sway in the Empire, the Black Rose seemed to vanish overnight. Many believed that perhaps their time had simply passed, and that its members had put aside their quests for social and political dominance. When LeBlanc reemerged at the gates of the Institute of War, however, it became clear that these masters of shadow and flame had simply been biding their time, waiting for a new global authority to emerge: the League of Legends.<br><br>''The world is very different for those who cannot see beyond what is placed before their very eyes.''<br>-- LeBlanc, the Deceiver","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.5,"mpregen":6,"attackrange":525,"attackspeedoffset":0,"mp":334,"hpperlevel":75,"hp":516,"hpregen":7.42,"mpregenperlevel":0.8,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":335,"mpperlevel":50,"armor":21.88,"armorperlevel":3.5,"attackdamage":54.88,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":1.4,"hpregenperlevel":0.55},"partype":"Mana","name":"LeBlanc","id":7,"title":"the Deceiver","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell5.png","x":432,"h":48,"y":96,"full":"LeblancChaosOrb.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"6","cost":[50,60,70,80,90],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ cost }} -> {{ costnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Mana Cost"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"700","tooltip":"Deals {{ e1 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> magic damage and marks the target for 3.5 seconds.<br><br>If the target takes damage from one of LeBlanc's abilities, the mark will trigger, dealing {{ e2 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a2 }})<\/span> magic damage.","description":"LeBlanc projects an orb towards her target, dealing magic damage and marking the target for 3.5 seconds.
