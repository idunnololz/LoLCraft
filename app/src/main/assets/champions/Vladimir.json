The area surrounding the temple is littered with the exsanguinated corpses of those who have mistakenly wandered too close. These served only to pique the curiosity of Vladimir, when - in his youth - he trekked through these mountains during his flight from Noxus. A day earlier, the teenaged Vladimir had brutally murdered two boys his age, for no better reason than to enjoy the intoxicating scarlet bloom that surged forth. He realized immediately that he would never be able to suppress his murderous desires, and if he remained in Noxus, his foul deeds were sure to catch up with him. Without hesitation, he abandoned the city-state, and journeyed south.<br><br>The trail of bodies led him to a crumbling stone temple. Inside he found an aging monk who appraised him with eyes of pure crimson. Vladimir surprised the monk by returning the wicked gaze with zeal. Recognizing the boy's sinister craving, the monk taught Vladimir how to manipulate and control the fluid of life, often practicing on passing travelers. When it came time for Vladimir to learn the final lesson, the monk warned that failure would result in death. Vladimir did not fail, but success bore a grisly surprise. During the ritual, every drop of the monk's blood was drawn from his body and fused with Vladimir's, imbuing him with his master's magical essence, and that of every hemomancer before him. Left alone and suddenly without purpose, Vladimir resolved to return to Noxus, demanding enrollment in the League to prove the supremacy of his craft. When the Noxian High Command observed the gruesome fates which befell the palace guards, they elected to avail themselves of Vladimir's unsavory talents.<br><br>''That which runs through you will run you through.''<br>-- Vladimir","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3,"mpregen":0,"attackrange":450,"attackspeedoffset":-0.05,"mp":0,"hpperlevel":85,"hp":542.8,"hpregen":7.005,"mpregenperlevel":0,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":335,"mpperlevel":0,"armor":21.88,"armorperlevel":3.5,"attackdamage":48.04,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":2,"hpregenperlevel":0.6},"partype":"None","name":"Vladimir","id":8,"title":"the Crimson Reaper","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell11.png","x":288,"h":48,"y":96,"full":"VladimirTransfusion.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"10/8.5/7/5.5/4","cost":[0,0,0,0,0],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Heal","Cooldown"]},"resource":"No Cost","rangeBurn":"600","tooltip":"Vladimir drains the lifeforce of his target, dealing {{ e1 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> magic damage and healing himself for {{ e2 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a2 }})<\/span>.","description":"Vladimir drains life from his target.","range":[600,600,600,600,600],"maxrank":5,"sanitizedTooltip":"Vladimir drains the lifeforce of his target, dealing {{ e1 }} (+{{ a1 }}) magic damage and healing himself for {{ e2 }} (+{{ a2 }}).","costType":"NoCost","effect":[null,[90,125,160,195,230],[15,25,35,45,55]],"name":"Transfusion","cooldown":[10,8.5,7,5.5,4],"costBurn":"0","vars":[{"link":"spelldamage","key":"a1","coeff":[0.6]},{"link":"spelldamage","key":"a2","coeff":[0.25]}],"sanitizedDescription":"Vladimir drains life from his target.","effectBurn":["","90/125/160/195/230","15/25/35/45/55"],"key":"VladimirTransfusion"},{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell11.png","x":336,"h":48,"y":96,"full":"VladimirSanguinePool.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"26/23/20/17/14","cost":[0,0,0,0,0],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e3 }} -> {{ e3NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Cooldown"]},"resource":"{{ e2 }}% of current Health","rangeBurn":"350","tooltip":"Vladimir sinks into a pool of blood for 2 seconds, becoming untargetable and slowing enemies above him by 40%.<br><br>Vladimir deals {{ e3 }} <span class=\"colorCC3300\">(+{{ f1 }} [15% of bonus Health])<\/span> magic damage over the duration and heals himself for 15% of that amount.","description":"Vladimir sinks into a pool of blood, becoming untargetable for 2 seconds.
