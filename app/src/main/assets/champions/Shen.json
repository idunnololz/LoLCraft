Order, chaos, light, darkness - all things must exist in perfect harmony for such is the way of the universe. This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors to uphold its causes in the world. Shen is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of Watching the Stars - exercising judgment untainted by prejudice.<br><br>Born to a clan whose members have decorated the ranks of the Kinkou for generations, Shen was trained his entire life to become the Eye of Twilight, and thereupon to dispassionately determine what must be done in the interests of equilibrium. As his final trial to ascend to this position, he was made to attend the Takanu, a ceremony in which his father was tortured before his eyes to test his resolve. Any reaction whatsoever would have resulted in his immediate disqualification, but he never averted his gaze and never blinked, not once. As the Eye of Twilight, Shen must make decisions that would buckle the wills of ordinary men, removing all emotion from the equation. He now works with his fellows Akali and Kennen to enforce the balance of Valoran. This hallowed pursuit has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of Justice.<br><br>The Eye of Twilight sees not the despair of its victims, only the elegance of equilibrium.","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.375,"mpregen":50,"attackrange":125,"attackspeedoffset":-0.04,"mp":200,"hpperlevel":85,"hp":570.8,"hpregen":8.37,"mpregenperlevel":0,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":335,"mpperlevel":0,"armor":25.72,"armorperlevel":4,"attackdamage":60.17,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":3.4,"hpregenperlevel":0.55},"partype":"Energy","name":"Shen","id":98,"title":"Eye of Twilight","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell8.png","x":384,"h":48,"y":144,"full":"ShenVorpalStar.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"6/5.5/5/4.5/4","cost":[60,60,60,60,60],"leveltip":{"effect":[" {{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}"," {{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Base Heal Amount","Cooldown"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Energy","rangeBurn":"475","tooltip":"Deals {{ e1 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> magic damage to target unit and marks them for {{ e4 }} seconds.<br><br>Allied spells and attacks against this target heal the attackers {{ f1 }} ({{ e2 }} <span class=\"colorCC3300\">+ {{ f2 }} [{{ e3 }}% of Shen's max Health]<\/span>) over {{ e5 }} seconds.<br><br>Killing an enemy with Vorpal Blade restores {{ f3 }} Health instantly instead.","description":"Damages and life taps a target unit, healing allies that attack the target.","range":[475,475,475,475,475],"analysis":[[268435459,1,60,100,140,180,220,0.6,"spelldamage"],[2,0,0,0,0,0,0]],"maxrank":5,"sanitizedTooltip":"Deals {{ e1 }} (+{{ a1 }}) magic damage to target unit and marks them for {{ e4 }} seconds.
