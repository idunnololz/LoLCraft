As was his people's way, Kegan sailed far and wide with his fellows, stealing treasures from those unlucky enough to catch their attention. To some, he was a monster; to others, just a man. One night, as they sailed through the arctic waters, strange lights danced over the frozen wastes. There was something hypnotic about them; it was something that drew them to it like moths to a flame. Trekking across the frozen waste, they came to a cave covered in ancient runes. The meaning of the runes long lost to them, Kegan led the way inside. There, inside a perfect cage of ice floated a dancing column of flame. There was no way such a thing should be burning, especially not in this place. However, its movement was as hypnotic as a siren's song, captivating and seductive. While the others stayed back, Kegan could not help but approach it while holding out his hand...<br><br>That is the last thing Kegan Rodhe remembers, for now his body belongs to Brand. It is a creature of olden times, perhaps even a casualty of the Rune Wars. It is known in ancient texts as the Burning Vengeance. It is a creature of pure fiery hate that exists for no other reason than to lay waste the world of men and yordles. No one is quite sure how Brand found his way to Valoran, but he began his predations at once. Overcome by Demacian forces, he was given a choice: fight within the confines of the League or die. Naturally, he chose to use his destructive powers in the League, for now...<br><br>''This place will burn, not by cinder flying or breath of wind, but by the vengeance of my hand.''<br>-- Brand","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3,"mpregen":8.005,"attackrange":550,"attackspeedoffset":0,"mp":325.6,"hpperlevel":76,"hp":507.68,"hpregen":5.42,"mpregenperlevel":0.6,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":340,"mpperlevel":45,"armor":21.88,"armorperlevel":3.5,"attackdamage":57.04,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":1.36,"hpregenperlevel":0.55},"partype":"Mana","name":"Brand","id":63,"title":"the Burning Vengeance","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell1.png","x":192,"h":48,"y":48,"full":"BrandBlaze.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"8/7.5/7/6.5/6","cost":[50,50,50,50,50],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Cooldown"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"1050","tooltip":"Brand launches a ball of fire forward that deals {{ e1 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> magic damage.<br><br><span class=\"colorDDDD77\">Blaze:<\/span> If the target is ablaze, Sear will stun the target for 2 seconds.","description":"Brand launches a ball of fire forward that deals magic damage.
