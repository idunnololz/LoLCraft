He survived a childhood in the pirate-run slums using every dirty trick in the book. Intent on building a new life for himself, he stowed away on the first ship to the mainland he could sneak aboard. However, the grim realities of the world forced him to eke out an unsavory living in the underground of various city-states, jumping the border whenever things got too hot. At a particularly high-stakes game of cards, he found himself seated opposite Twisted Fate. They both flipped four aces on the final hand.  It was the first time either conman had met his equal.

Graves endured years of captivity at the hands of Zaun's most unscrupulous wardens before he managed to escape. One of his fellow detainees introduced him to an eccentric gunsmith who modified a shotgun exactly to his specifications. After he paid a visit to Priggs, Graves joined the League of Legends with two targets in his sights: Twisted Fate and payback.<br><br>''They got a saying in the locker: ain't got nothin' but time to plan.''<br>-Graves","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.1,"mpregen":7.925,"attackrange":525,"attackspeedoffset":0,"mp":322.2,"hpperlevel":84,"hp":551.12,"hpregen":6.675,"mpregenperlevel":0.7,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":330,"mpperlevel":40,"armor":24.376,"armorperlevel":3.2,"attackdamage":54.208,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":2.9,"hpregenperlevel":0.7},"partype":"Mana","name":"Graves","id":104,"title":"the Outlaw","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell3.png","x":48,"h":48,"y":96,"full":"GravesClusterShot.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"12/11/10/9/8","cost":[60,70,80,90,100],"leveltip":{"effect":[" {{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}","{{ cost }} -> {{ costnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Cooldown","Mana Cost "]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"700","tooltip":"Shoots three bullets in a cone, each dealing {{ e1 }}<span class=\"colorFF8C00\"> (+{{ f1 }})<\/span> physical damage to all enemies in their path.
