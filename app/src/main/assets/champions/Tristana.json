They have a history that spans centuries, and they remain the oldest yordle military unit still in service. They are renowned for their courage, deadliness, and ruthlessness, making them the most respected and feared of all warriors in Bandle City. Legends of Megling, the valiant founder of the commandos, are still heard throughout Valoran's taverns. It was these legends that most fascinated a young Tristana. Since she was a wee child, Tristana wanted nothing more than to become the crack shot that her idol had been all those years ago. She trained her entire life, until finally she was old enough to join the military and able to earn her place among the Megling Commandos. The senior officers were impressed by her abilities, claiming that Tristana was a natural, and her dream was realized the day she donned her Megling fatigues.<br><br>Though her heart lies with her unit, the call to the League of Legends was irresistible and now Tristana protects Bandle City as a champion. While intense and focused as a Megling Gunner, Tristana is remarkably different in her personal life. Outside the Fields of Justice, she is friendly and cheerful - the sort of yordle who always has a kind word for everyone. Tristana recently struck up a close friendship with Teemo, the Swift Scout. They are both members of Bandle City's Special Forces, so not only do they bond as yordles, but also as fellow warriors and champions... though she outright ignores any questions pertaining to a blossoming romance.<br><br>''If there's one person I'd trust to take on a difficult mission, it's Tristana - all day long!''<br>-- Teemo","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3,"mpregen":7.205,"attackrange":550,"attackspeedoffset":-0.04734,"mp":246.76,"hpperlevel":82,"hp":552.76,"hpregen":6.19,"mpregenperlevel":0.45,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":325,"mpperlevel":32,"armor":24.04,"armorperlevel":3,"attackdamage":49.54,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":0,"attackspeedperlevel":2.5,"hpregenperlevel":0.65},"partype":"Mana","name":"Tristana","id":18,"title":"the Megling Gunner","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell9.png","x":240,"h":48,"y":96,"full":"RapidFire.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"20","cost":[0,0,0,0,0],"leveltip":{"effect":[" {{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}%"],"label":["Attack Speed % "]},"resource":"No Cost","rangeBurn":"self","tooltip":"Increases Tristana's Attack Speed by {{ e1 }}% for 5 seconds.","description":"Tristana fires her weapon rapidly, increasing her Attack Speed for a short time.","range":"self","analysis":[[1,0,1,0.3,0.45,0.6,0.75,0.9,"PercentAttackSpeedMod"]],"maxrank":5,"sanitizedTooltip":"Increases Tristana's Attack Speed by {{ e1 }}% for 5 seconds.","costType":"NoCost","effect":[null,[30,50,70,90,110]],"name":"Rapid Fire","cooldown":[20,20,20,20,20],"costBurn":"0","sanitizedDescription":"Tristana fires her weapon rapidly, increasing her Attack Speed for a short time.","effectBurn":["","30/50/70/90/110"],"key":"RapidFire"},{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell9.png","x":288,"h":48,"y":96,"full":"RocketJump.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"22/20/18/16/14","cost":[60,60,60,60,60],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ e3 }} -> {{ e3NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Slow Duration","Cooldown"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"900","tooltip":"Tristana fires at the ground to propel herself to target location, dealing {{ e1 }} <span class=\"color99FF99\">(+{{ a1 }})<\/span> Magic Damage and slowing surrounding units by 60% for {{ e3 }} seconds when she lands.<br>On a champion kill or assist, Rocket Jump's cooldown resets.","description":"Tristana fires at the ground to propel herself to a distant location, dealing damage and slowing surrounding units for 3 seconds where she lands.","range":[900,900,900,900,900],"analysis":[[-1879048189,1,70,115,160,205,250,0.8,"spelldamage"],[6,0,2,900,900,900,900,900],[4,0,2,0.6,1,0.6,1.5,0.6,2,0.6,2.5,0.6,3]],"maxrank":5,"sanitizedTooltip":"Tristana fires at the ground to propel herself to target location, dealing {{ e1 }} (+{{ a1 }}) Magic Damage and slowing surrounding units by 60% for {{ e3 }} seconds when she lands.
