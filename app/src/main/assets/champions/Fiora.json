She boasts the refinement of an aristocratic upbringing, and a fierce devotion to the perfection of her craft. Having surpassed her peers at home, Fiora now seeks greater foes. She will settle for nothing less than the world's acknowledgement of her mastery.<br><br>As the youngest child of House Laurent, a family known for its long line of elite duelists, Fiora considered herself destined for greatness. She longed to match the skill of her father, a legendary swordsman, and her talent quickly surpassed that of her siblings. Fiora's peers perceived her confidence as arrogance, but she dismissed them, striving even harder to become a worthy successor to her father. Her devotion turned out to be misplaced. On the eve of an arranged duel, authorities caught Fiora's father slipping a paralysis poison into his opponent's drink. His treachery destroyed the family's reputation, and Fiora's own honor fell under question. Outraged and desperate to clear her name, she challenged her father to a duel. Though he fought with power and style, Fiora realized the man had long forgotten the discipline that defined a true duelist. She disarmed him, and with her blade to his chest, she demanded control of House Laurent. Her father surrendered, but even in victory, Fiora knew the shadow of doubt still tainted her reputation. Intent to seize her destiny, Fiora vows to surpass her father's false legacy and prove that she is not only the greatest duelist in Demacia - but all of Valoran.<br><br>''I came here seeking a challenge - is this the best these fools can offer me?''<br>-- Fiora","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":3.2,"mpregen":7.59,"attackrange":125,"attackspeedoffset":-0.07,"mp":287.2,"hpperlevel":85,"hp":592.8,"hpregen":6.84,"mpregenperlevel":0.5,"spellblock":32.1,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":350,"mpperlevel":40,"armor":24.88,"armorperlevel":3.5,"attackdamage":59.876,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":1.25,"attackspeedperlevel":3,"hpregenperlevel":0.8},"partype":"Mana","name":"Fiora","id":114,"title":"the Grand Duelist","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell2.png","x":144,"h":48,"y":144,"full":"FioraQ.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"16/14/12/10/8","cost":[60,60,60,60,60],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e1 }} -> {{ e1NL }}","{{ cooldown }} -> {{ cooldownnNL }}"],"label":["Damage","Cooldown"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"600","tooltip":"Fiora dashes forward to strike her target, dealing {{ e1 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ f1 }})<\/span> physical damage.<br><br>Fiora can perform the dash a second time within {{ e2 }} seconds at no Mana cost.","description":"Fiora dashes forward to strike her target, dealing physical damage.
