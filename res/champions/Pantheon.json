They remember the Rune Wars of Runeterra and know that the League of Legends can only repress the rising tides of violence for so long. Each member of the tribe is bred to be a disciplined and vicious warrior, preferring to battle soldiers of either the Noxian or Demacian armies only when outnumbered at least ten to one. Rakkor warriors are trained not only to be as lethal with their bare hands as the most capable martial artists, but also to fiercely wield the many relic-weapons of the tribe. Such treasures have been handed down from generation to generation, and have harnessed the mystical nature of Runeterra in their very cores. These relic-weapons are among the most dangerous in existence - and it comes as no surprise that they have found their way to the League of Legends in the hands of Pantheon.<br><br>This stone-faced warrior is a paragon of his people, his very existence an anthem of exultation to the art of combat. Pantheon found it insulting that the people of Valoran would install an organization to replace war, complete with so-called champions, without including the Rakkor. Gathering the blessings of his tribe and armed with the relics of his ancestors, he has descended on the League to show the world a true warrior. He cares not who he fights, and cares nothing for the pageantry or prestige of a League champion, but lives only for the austere glory of battle. As long as Pantheon breathes, he thirsts for another foe to vanquish.<br><br>''I was hoping they had more reinforcements.''<br>-- Pantheon, standing amidst the pieces of a brutalized Noxian battalion.","stats":{"attackdamageperlevel":2.9,"mpregen":6.6,"attackrange":150,"attackspeedoffset":-0.08,"mp":210,"hpperlevel":87,"hp":433,"hpregen":6.75,"mpregenperlevel":0.45,"spellblock":30,"critperlevel":0,"movespeed":355,"mpperlevel":34,"armor":21.1,"armorperlevel":3.9,"attackdamage":50.7,"crit":0,"spellblockperlevel":1.25,"attackspeedperlevel":2.95,"hpregenperlevel":0.65},"partype":"Mana","name":"Pantheon","id":80,"title":"the Artisan of War","spells":[{"image":{"w":48,"sprite":"spell13.png","x":144,"h":48,"y":48,"full":"PantheonQ.png","group":"spell"},"cooldownBurn":"4","cost":[45,45,45,45,45],"leveltip":{"effect":["{{ e2 }} -> {{ e2NL }}"],"label":["Base Damage"]},"resource":"{{ cost }} Mana","rangeBurn":"600","tooltip":"Pantheon hurls his spear at an opponent, dealing {{ e2 }} <span class=\"colorFF8C00\">(+{{ f1 }})<\/span> physical damage.
